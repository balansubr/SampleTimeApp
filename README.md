== README

This is a simple app to demonstrate the use of app.json. The app simply shows the time prefaced with a greeting. The greeting is personalized using configuration variables defined in app.json. The app.json also specifies which addons should be provisioned and what post-deployment scripts should be run.

To get started with the app: {Deploy on Heroku}[https://app-assembly.herokuapp.com/?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbalansubr%2FSampleTimeApp%2Ftarball%2Fmaster%2F&json=clock_app.json]
